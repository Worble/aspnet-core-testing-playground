Just some playing about with AspNet Core 2 things. Uses a PostGres database with EF Core 2 just for funsies and includes a seed method on startup. Includes overriding the razer template, dependency injection in the view engine, basic cookie authentication that also reacts to backend changes, some minor routing, pagination, and searching the database. Uses Bcrypt.DotNetCore for password hashing.
